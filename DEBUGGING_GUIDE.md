# School Results Management System - Debugging Guide

## Issues Found and Solutions

### 1. PHP Not Installed ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: PHP was not available in the environment
**Error**: `bash: php: command not found`
**Solution**: 
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y php php-sqlite3 php-cli
```
**Verification**: `php -v` shows PHP 8.4.5 installed

### 2. Syntax Error in settings.php ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Duplicate line and incomplete if statement in settings.php
**Error**: `PHP Parse error: syntax error, unexpected variable "$existing", expecting "(" in /workspace/settings.php on line 43`
**Location**: Lines 42-43 in settings.php
**Issue**: 
```php
// Broken code
$existing = $db->fetchOne("SELECT id FROM settings WHERE key = ?", [$key]);
if
$existing = $db->fetchOne("SELECT id FROM settings WHERE key = ?", [$key]);
```
**Solution**: Removed duplicate line and fixed incomplete if statement:
```php
// Fixed code
$existing = $db->fetchOne("SELECT id FROM settings WHERE key = ?", [$key]);
if ($existing) {
```

### 3. SQLite Command Line Tool Missing ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Unable to inspect database directly
**Solution**: 
```bash
sudo apt install -y sqlite3
```

## Current Status: ✅ FULLY FUNCTIONAL

### Database Status
- **Database File**: `/workspace/database/school_results.db` (102KB)

| Principal | principal@school.com | password |
| Teacher | john@school.com | password |
| Class Teacher | mary@school.com | password |
| Teacher | peter@school.com | password |

### Verified Functionality
- ✅ PHP 8.4 with SQLite support
- ✅ Database setup and table creation
- ✅ User authentication system
- ✅ Web server functionality (PHP built-in server on port 8000)
- ✅ All PHP files have valid syntax
- ✅ Login/logout functionality
- ✅ Dashboard access
- ✅ Settings page loads correctly

## How to Run the Application

### 1. Start the Web Server
```bash
cd /workspace
php -S localhost:8000
```

### 2. Access the Application
- **Setup** (if needed): `http://localhost:8000/setup.php`
- **Login**: `http://localhost:8000/login.php`
- **Dashboard**: `http://localhost:8000/dashboard.php`

### 3. First Time Setup
If the database doesn't exist:
1. Go to `http://localhost:8000/setup.php`
2. Click "Setup Database"
3. Wait for success message
4. Click "Go to Login"

## Testing Commands

### Database Inspection
```bash
# Check tables
sqlite3 /workspace/database/school_results.db "SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';"

# Check users
sqlite3 /workspace/database/school_results.db "SELECT email, role FROM users;"

# Check database size
ls -la /workspace/database/school_results.db
```

### PHP Syntax Validation
```bash
# Check specific file
php -l /workspace/settings.php

# Check all PHP files
find /workspace -name "*.php" -exec php -l {} \; | grep -v "No syntax errors"
```

### Web Server Testing
```bash
# Test setup page
curl -s http://localhost:8000/setup.php | head -20

# Test login page
curl -s http://localhost:8000/login.php | head -20

# Test login functionality
curl -X POST -d "email=admin@school.com&password=password" -c cookies.txt http://localhost:8000/login.php

# Test dashboard with login
curl -b cookies.txt -L http://localhost:8000/dashboard.php | head -20
```

## System Requirements Met

### PHP Version ✅
- **Required**: PHP 7.4 or higher
- **Installed**: PHP 8.4.5
- **Extensions**: SQLite3, PDO SQLite

### File Permissions ✅
- Database directory: writable (755)
- Database file: readable/writable (644)

### Web Server ✅
- PHP built-in server running on localhost:8000
- Apache/Nginx could also be used

## Troubleshooting Guide

### If Database Setup Fails
1. Check file permissions: `ls -la /workspace/database/`
2. Verify PHP SQLite extension: `php -m | grep sqlite`
3. Delete database file and re-run setup: `rm /workspace/database/school_results.db`

### If Login Fails
1. Verify demo credentials (case-sensitive)
2. Check database has users: `sqlite3 /workspace/database/school_results.db "SELECT * FROM users;"`
3. Clear browser cookies
4. Check if setup was completed

### If Pages Don't Load
1. Verify web server is running: `ps aux | grep php`
2. Check PHP syntax: `php -l filename.php`
3. Check error logs in browser developer tools
4. Verify file paths in includes
